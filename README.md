# NLR Coffea Bioinformatics Pipeline 
This is a simple program I wrote to automate the process of analyzing the output of the tool NLR-Annotator. What it does is use Entrez to search for the presence of annotated genes in NCBI Gene database, fetch their information and generate a fasta file with the annotated protein sequences. 

It also generates a graph to compare how much the tool was correct according to gene size.
